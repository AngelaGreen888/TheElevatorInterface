**Basic Issues with the Elevator**
- The internal interface has no sound when pressing buttons, or arriving at the destination.
- The directional arrows in the internal interface (that show  which direction the elevator is going) is in the same space as the doors. They're only visible from one side of the elevator.
- The buttons and labels have been heavily used and it's prevalent in the chipped paint on the labels.

**Why the Basic Issues are Bad**
- The internal interface's lack of sound isn't crucial to having a good design, although it would help the user's experience in knowing if the doors are about to open or letting the user know that they arrived at their destination.
- Hiding the directional arrows is definitely a poor design choice. Instead of implementing a 2-in-1 screen with both the floor number and the directional arrow on one screen, they separated them making the user have to look at two different places. The user is unable to see the arrow unless they are in a specific area in the elevator. This should be something that's visible for any user from any area when riding in the elevator.
- If the labels get worn down, it can be hard to read which destination correlates to which button.
